## Algorithms ùí≤ and ‚Ñ≥ in Agda
Implementation of Hindley-Milner type inference algorithms ùí≤ (Milner 1978) and ‚Ñ≥ (Lee
and Yi 1998). Available for reference as algorithms.

## Notice

This project is to aid my own understanding of these algorithms. I chose Agda
because I like it. **I do not claim any formalization of metatheory**. In
particular, I use a named representation (with names ‚àà ‚Ñï) under the [Barendregt
convention](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/69323/barendregts-variable-convention-what-does-it-mean).

I suspect formalization would not be terribly novel or difficult, but one would
first need to switch variable representation to either DeBruijn or locally
nameless (see Chargu√©raud (2012)). I would recommend locally nameless, as
algorithms ùí≤ and ‚Ñ≥ require the generation of "new" type variables, which the
locally nameless style provides via "atoms".
